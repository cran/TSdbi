KNOWN BUGS

    o Warning messages about "show" are diplayed when some of the plugin
      packages are attached. 

    o There is a warning message about ambiguous slot choice in the integer 
      coercion of the connection con. (This is a bug in DBI packages.)

    o See also TO DO below.


CHANGES IN TSdbi VERSION 2008.11-1

    o  A mechanism has been added for (optionally) allowing different vintages 
       and panels of the data series. (e.g. series with the same identifier 
       but a different release date or country).

    o  More database plugins have been added  (PostgreSQL, ODBC, Fame). 

    o  A mechanism to support multilingual documentation as been added (but not
       yet well tested).
 
    o  The is support to specify what time series representation should be 
       returned.

    o  Vignettes have been expanded.

    o  The class representation of some objects was cleaned up and improved.

    o renamed class TSdbOptions to TSdb and change TS*Connection classes to
      include it in their representation rather than with contains.

    o changed fields refPeriod to refperiod in tables to avoid capitalization 
      issues among SQL version. Changed TSrefPeriod to TSrefperiod to avoid 
      confusion.

    o changed tables Panels to panels and Vintages to vintages, to avoid
      confusion, but tables do not seem to suffer from the capitalization issue.  

    o changed "double" to "double precision" and DATETIME to TIMESTAMP in 
      inst/TSsql/CreateTables.TSsql as these work in other SQL versions 
      as well as MySQL.

CHANGES IN TSdbi VERSION 2008.8-1

    o adjusted TSquery to use standard sql extract(YEAR rather than mysql YEAR(.

    o fixed bug in TSquery for case of a query returning only one period. 


CHANGES IN TSdbi VERSION 2008.5-1

    o Work around for bug in R 2.7.0 

    o Added TSquery (even though it is not logically part of this package). 

    o Misc. clean up of beta. 

    o vintages is working but not carefully tested. Panels may be working, but
      not at all tested.
